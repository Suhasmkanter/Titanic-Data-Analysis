For those who are reading the Readme for the Titanic-Data-analysis 
I actually used only the two Machine learning Models which are Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier 
For the Logistic Regression the accuracy is about the 79 to 80 
for the RandomForestClassifier the accuracy is about the 82 
You can improve it by the feature selection and by checking with the other models like SVM , Catboost or XGBoost models which will provide even high accuracy  it is my first project i keep it minimum Thank You ðŸ˜Š
